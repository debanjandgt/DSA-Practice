In an online game, N blocks are arranged in a hierarchical manner. All the blocks are connected together by a total of N-1 connections. Each block is given an ID from 1 to N. A block may be further connected to other blocks. Each block is also assigned a specific point value.

A player starts from Block 1. She must move forward from each block to a directly connected block until she reaches the final block, which has no further connection. When the player lands on a block, she collects the point value of that block. The players score is calculated as the product of point values that the player collects.
Find the maximum score a player can achieve.
Note: The answer can always be represented with 64 bits.


Example 1:

Input:
     4
    / \
   2   8
  / \ / \
 2  1 3  4
Output: 128
Explanation: Path in the given tree 
goes like 4, 8, 4 which gives the max
score of 4x8x4 = 128.
Example 2:

Input:
     10
   /    \
  7      5
          \
           1
Output: 70
Explanation: The path 10, 7 gives a 
score of 70 which is the maximum possible.

Your Task:
You don't need to take input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findMaxScore() that takes root as input and returns max score possible.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Height of the Tree).
